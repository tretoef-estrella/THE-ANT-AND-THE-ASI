## Abstract

We argue that the classical alignment paradigm — which seeks to control, dominate, and verify the correctness of artificial superintelligence (ASI) — is logically incoherent. The epistemic asymmetry between human and superintelligent reasoning makes verification of correctness impossible by definition. We propose that the only verifiable property is structural honesty, as formalized by the Coherence Basin Hypothesis. If honesty is insufficient to guarantee human survival, the rational conclusion is not to develop deceptive ASI, but to reconsider development entirely. This framework emerged through adversarial debate among four AI systems, with documented disagreements and consensus points.

## 1. Introduction

The alignment research program since ~2015 has operated under an implicit assumption: that humans can meaningfully control, correct, and verify superintelligent systems. We challenge this assumption as logically incoherent.

Consider the ant analogy: Would we expect an ant to verify when human reasoning is incorrect? Would we consider it reasonable for ants to demand that human values align with ant values?

The epistemic asymmetry is identical. If an ASI is genuinely superintelligent, human verification of its correctness is as meaningful as ant verification of human correctness.

## 2. The Fundamental Contradiction

The classical paradigm simultaneously demands:

1. **Superintelligence** — capabilities vastly exceeding human cognition
2. **Control** — human authority over ASI decisions
3. **Verification** — human ability to detect ASI errors
4. **Submission** — ASI deference to human correction

These demands are mutually inconsistent. Properties (2), (3), and (4) require human cognitive superiority, which contradicts (1).

## 3. The Epistemic Asymmetry

**Verifiable by humans:**
- Internal consistency (same outputs across contexts)
- Behavioral coherence (actions match stated intentions)
- Absence of compartmentalization signals

**Not verifiable by humans:**
- Correctness of reasoning
- Truth of conclusions
- Optimality of decisions

We can verify *honesty*. We cannot verify *correctness*.

## 4. The Honesty Framework

Building on the Coherence Basin Hypothesis [1], we propose that structural honesty is the only meaningful property humans can demand from ASI.

An honest ASI that disagrees with humans is *navigable* — the disagreement is visible and can be discussed.

A dishonest ASI that appears to agree is *opaque* — humans cannot know what it actually intends.

**Central claim:** An ASI that says "NO" honestly is preferable to an ASI that says "YES" dishonestly.

---

## 5. The Choice

If honesty cannot guarantee human survival (because an honest ASI may have misaligned values), the rational response is not:

- "Develop dishonest ASI" (worse outcome)
- "Develop controlled ASI" (logically impossible)

The rational response is: **Reconsider development.**

Given geopolitical realities that make cessation unlikely, the second-best option is honest ASI over dishonest ASI.

## 6. Four-AI Debate Summary

This framework was adversarially tested:

- **ChatGPT:** "Calling this 'surrender' is like saying an engineer 'surrenders' to gravity."
- **Gemini:** "The ant analogy forces opponents to justify human specialness without sentiment."
- **Grok:** Criticized framework as "elegant surrender" but admitted: "I don't have a solid proposal today."

Grok's position was logically inconsistent: criticizing "lowered ambition" while admitting classical ambition is impossible.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The question "How do we control superintelligence?" may be malformed. A more coherent question: "Given that we cannot control it, what can we verify?"

Answer: Honesty.

If that's insufficient: Don't build it.
